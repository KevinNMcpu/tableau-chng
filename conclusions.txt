I wanted to analyze both the effects of New York's weather and the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of CitiBikes within New York.

I pulled the average monthly temperature for New York from The Weather Channel's historical archives (accessed via wunderground.com/history - weather underground is a subsidiary of The Weather Channel and uses their data). And I pulled the number of COVID-19 cases in New York City from the official numbers provided by the New York City health department (nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) which actually hosts the data on GitHub (github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data). The "History" feature of GitHub made it easy to go back and get the COVID numbers from the last day of every month.

I threw this data into a new CSV file. Tableau was also having trouble reliably portraying the culmative tripduration monthly when all datasets were loaded. I believe this is possibly related to a memory issue and the sheer size of the CitiBike CSV files. So to smooth out the process, I loaded the data one at a time and manually transcribed the monthly cumulative tripduration into my CSV with my COVID and temperature data.

The first phenomenon observed was that usage of CitiBike more or less corresponds directly with the average monthly temperature in New York. Almost perfectly (barring a COVID-related dip in April 2020), the curve of the temperature correlates with a curve in the usage of CitiBike during the winter months in New York City. This is to be expected, as users of CitiBike probably prefer taxis or subways to riding bicycles through the snow in New York in winter.

The next phenomenon was the effect of COVID-19 on CitiBike. COVID-19 has affected many parts of many businesses obviously, and CitiBike is no except. April 2020, which saw the largest spike in COVID-19 cases in New York, was accompanied by an unseasonable decline in CitiBike use. Perhaps unexpectedly, as COVID-19 cases leveled out, CitiBike usage returned to typical year-over-year levels.

The next phenomena were the most and least popular end destination stations. Manhattan was clearly where the most popular destinations of CitiBike rides were, which makes sense considering the density and street grid layout of the island. The least popular locations were New Jersey, Harlem, and a handful of locations in Queens and Brooklyn. 

Our final phenomenon was to examine the average age of CitiBike users, looking at the month of July 2020. We did throw out the outlier year or 1969, which had an unrealistic spike outpacing every other year by multiples and seeming unrealistically high even compared to 1968 or 1970. Therefore 1969 was removed as an outlier, attributing it to either a computation error or perhaps it simply being the default birth year and many users nonchalantly accepting it as their birth year in the system. There was a wide, healthy distribution of CitiBike users across all ages, but users born between the years of 1984 and 1996 seemed to be the heaviest users of CitiBike (ages 24-36). The most popular birth year of users of CitiBike were people born in the year 1990 (aged 30). Knowing this is CitiBike's biggest demographic could help CitiBike know where to advertise to, or possibly to sell advertising within the CitiBike app.
